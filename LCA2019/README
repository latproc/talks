These are the presentations for LCA2019 (linux.conf.au) 

The slides use the reveal.js presentation toolkit

The slide source is in 'slides' and there are some tools in scripts/ that
generate the html files in the presentations directory. The scripts/render
program tries hard to render a talk from a list of slides.

To view the presentation html files copy them to the server directory 
above or (better) create a symbolic link there:

  cd ../server
  ln -sf ../presentations/mtme.html index.html

if you run a server (npm start) in the server directory you 
will be able to see speaker notes. 

There are pdf versions of the presentations also in the 
presentations/ directory..
